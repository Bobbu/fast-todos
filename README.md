# fast-todos

A sample FastAPI-based API project that effectively implements a tutorial from Travis Media. 

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for working with FastAPI.  The initial commit provides a snapshot of the in-memory todos and basic methods.

I recommend you take the hour or so it will take to go through Travis' video [Travis Video](https://youtu.be/cbASjoZZGIw?si=kqkGHlsUB514cXMc) -- be sure to type along and explore the FastAPI docs as you do.
